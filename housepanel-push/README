housepanel-push.js is a Node.js app used with HousePanel to enable direct state pushes
to give users near immediate feedback about state changes made in their smart home
on the HousePanel dashboard. This is used together with polling to keep your dashboard
in sync with the status of your home.

Version 1.3.0 requires HousePanel 1.900 or later
it fixes a bug that was introduced when hub removal was enabled with hubId indexing

Once installed you must restart HousePanel
to activate the immediate feedback capability.
